# AltSendme

## About

AltSendme is a frictionless peer-to-peer file transfer cross-platform desktop application that enables users to send files and directories over the internet with no account requirements, end-to-end encryption, unlimited transfers, and full privacy control. Built using the [iroh](https://crates.io/crates/iroh) networking library, AltSendme provides direct file sharing between sender and receiver without intermediaries.

**Tagline**: Send files anywhere - Frictionless, Fast, Private, Unlimited and Free

## Core Technology

AltSendme is built on modern web technologies and leverages advanced networking protocols:

- **Iroh**: Core networking library for peer-to-peer connections and NAT traversal
- **Tauri**: Desktop application framework (v2) for building native desktop apps
- **React**: Modern UI framework for the user interface
- **QUIC Protocol**: Modern transport protocol for fast, reliable connections
- **TLS 1.3**: End-to-end encryption ensuring all traffic between endpoints is secured
- **Blake3**: Cryptographic hashing for verified streaming and data integrity

## Key Features

### Peer-to-Peer File Transfer
- Direct file sharing without intermediaries or central servers
- No account requirements - start transferring files immediately
- Direct transfer between sender and receiver only

### Security & Privacy
- **End-to-end encryption**: All traffic between endpoints is encrypted using QUIC + TLS 1.3
- **256-bit node IDs**: Secure identification and connection establishment
- **Full privacy control**: Users maintain complete control over their data
- **No data storage**: Files are transferred directly, not stored on servers

### Network Capabilities
- **NAT Hole Punching**: Iroh handles NAT traversal automatically, falling back to a relay if needed
- **Verified Streaming**: Blake3-verified streaming ensures data integrity during transfer
- **Resumable Downloads**: Interrupted downloads can be resumed seamlessly without starting over

### User Experience
- **Unlimited transfers**: No file size or transfer limits
- **Fast transfers**: Optimized for speed with modern protocols
- **Modern UI**: React-based interface built with modern web technologies
- **Cross-platform**: Native desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Interoperability
- **CLI Compatible**: Works seamlessly with the [sendme](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme) CLI tool
- **Ticket Exchange**: Tickets generated by CLI can be used in desktop and vice versa
- **Cross-version Support**: Both versions can send/receive to each other

## Platform Support

AltSendme is available for multiple platforms and architectures:

### Windows
- **Windows x64**: Executable installer (.exe)
- **Windows x64 MSI**: MSI installer package
- Latest version: v0.2.0

### macOS
- **Apple Silicon (ARM64)**: DMG package for M1/M2/M3 Macs
- **Intel x86_64**: DMG package for Intel-based Macs
- **Note**: Currently distributed without code signing. Users need to remove quarantine flag (see Installation section)
- Latest version: v0.2.0

### Linux
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: .deb package (amd64)

## Installation

### Download Options

The easiest way to get started is by downloading from GitHub Releases:
- **GitHub Releases**: https://github.com/tonyantony300/alt-sendme/releases
- **Website**: https://altsendme.com

### macOS Installation (Unsigned App)

AltSendme is currently distributed **without code signing**. When you first open it, macOS will show a security warning saying the application is damaged. Here is how you can run it:

**Remove Quarantine Flag (Terminal)**

1. Open Spotlight Search (⌘+space) - search for terminal and open
2. Paste the following command and hit enter:

```bash
cd /Applications && xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine AltSendme.app
```

The app is open source and safe - the warning is just macOS's gatekeeper for unsigned applications. Code signing will be added in future releases.

### How It Connects Remote Devices

AltSendme uses iroh's networking technology to establish connections between remote devices. For detailed information about how peer-to-peer connections work, see: https://www.iroh.computer/docs/faq

## CLI Compatibility

AltSendme uses the same core networking library as the [sendme](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme) CLI tool, providing full interoperability:

- Tickets generated by CLI can be used in desktop application
- Tickets generated by desktop can be used in CLI
- Both versions can send/receive to each other seamlessly
- Same underlying protocol ensures compatibility

## Supported Languages

AltSendme supports multiple languages for international users:

- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇹🇭 Thai
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇨🇳 Chinese
- 🇯🇵 Japanese
- 🇷🇺 Russian
- 🇰🇷 Korean

## Development

### Prerequisites

To contribute or run the app from source:

- **Rust**: 1.81 or higher
- **Node.js**: 18 or higher
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn

### Running in Development

1. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the desktop app**:
